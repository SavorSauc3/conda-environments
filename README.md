# conda-environments
Contains all the requirements for my different conda python environments

## Getting Started
For each of my python repositories, there is (usually) a specific environment that must be used in order to make all of the code work.
Most of the requirements.txt files are already in the repository, but I keep them in this github repository for personal reasons.
I figured I would make this public in case anyone wants to use these for their own purposes, they are labeled for their specific use case.
If you are new to python, environments basically hold the specific python files that your code uses to run. It is common to keep environments for different projects separated so that there are no conflicts between python packages that would cause the new code to not work properly.
